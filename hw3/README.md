## Description
We've explored quite a bit with iOS development, and learned how to make simple apps. Continuing this trend, we are eventually going to make a full-on iOS Hangman game for our next project. This homework assignment is dealing with some preliminiaries and setting up some of the first steps for creating the Hangman game. Namely, we will be using our new-found UI knowledge to create the View of the game.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. ** Add to HangmanViewController.swift and Main.Storyboard **
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.

## Requirements
1. Must have a "New Game" Button
2. Must have a "Guess Button
3. Must have a Textfield (where user enters letter as guess)
4. Must have a UILabel that indicates what guesses have been made. 
5. Must have an UIImageView that will represent the "state" of the man being hung.
6. You must create any necessary constraints for all subviews.
